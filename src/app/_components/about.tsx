                Back in 2018, I took Andrew Ng's machine learning course.
                I was fascinated by the idea of using a computer to learn and generalize from data.
                This course was what sparked my interest in machine learning and computer science.
                I would build small projects about topics I thought were cool and kept up with the latest developments in the field.

                It was around 8th grade when I was recruited by my brother to help work on a app idea over the summer.
                During this time, I was introduced to front-end development and learned how to use React Native.
                It was at <b><a href="https://github.com/jbis9051/bubble" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bubble</a></b> where
                I first developed a passion for web/app development.

                Currently, I'm doing research at the University of Michigan in the field of program synthesis. 
                I also participate in <b><a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/SeaUrc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Codeforce</a></b> competitions when I can.
